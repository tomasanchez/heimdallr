"""Models
Generally used in conjunction with an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise-ORM.
Models represent the structure of your application's data as it is stored in a database.
They are classes that define the attributes and relationships of the data entities you work with in your application.
